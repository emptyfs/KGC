## Dependency and their explanations
|  | Dep | explain | examples |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 0 | acl | clausal modifier of noun -  is used for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a noun | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/acl.html |
| 1 | acl:relcl | relative clause modifier - A relative clause modifier of an noun is a relative clause modifying the noun. The relation points from the noun that is modified to the head of the relative clause. Relative clauses are finite. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/acl-relcl.html |
| 2 | advcl | adverbial clause modifier - An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.), as a modifier not as a core complement. This includes things such as a temporal clause, consequence, conditional clause, purpose clause, etc. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an advmod) and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/advcl.html |
| 3 | advmod | adverbial modifier - An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) adverb or adverbial phrase (ADVP) that serves to modify the meaning of the word. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/advmod.html |
| 4 | amod | adjectival modifier - An adjectival modifier of an NP is any adjectival phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the NP. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/amod.html |
| 5 | appos | appositional modifier - An appositional modifier of an NP is an NP immediately to the right of the first NP that serves to define or modify that NP. It includes parenthesized examples, as well as defining abbreviations in one of these structures. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/appos.html |
| 6 | aux | auxiliary - An auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause, e.g., a modal auxiliary, or a form of be, do or have in a periphrastic tense. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/aux_.html |
| 7 | auxpass | passive auxiliary - A passive auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause which contains the passive information. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/auxpass.html |
| 8 | case | case marking - The case relation is used for any preposition in English. Prepositions are treated as dependents of the noun they attach to or introduce in an ‚Äúextended nominal projection‚Äù. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/case.html |
| 9 | cc | coordination - A coordination is the relation between an element of a conjunct and the coordinating conjunction word of the conjunct. (Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination. We take one conjunct of a conjunction (normally the first) as the head of the conjunction.) A conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also called a cc, and dependent on the root predicate of the sentence. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/cc.html |
| 10 | cc:preconj | preconjunct - A preconjunct is the relation between the head of an NP and a word that appears at the beginning bracketing a conjunction (and puts emphasis on it), such as either, both, neither). | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/cc-preconj.html |
| 11 | ccomp | clausal complement - A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause with an internal subject which functions like an object of the verb or adjective. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/ccomp.html |
| 12 | compound | compound - noun compounds (Note that in the current system for dependency extraction, all nouns modify the rightmost noun of the noun phrase ‚Äì there is no intelligent noun compound analysis. This is likely to be fixed once the Penn Treebank represents the branching structure of noun phrases.) | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/compound.html |
| 13 | compound:prt | phrasal verb particle - The phrasal verb particle relation identifies a phrasal verb, and holds between the verb and its particle. It is a subtype of the compound relation. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/compound-prt.html |
| 14 | conj | conjunct - A conjunct is the relation between two elements connected by a coordinating conjunction, such as and, or, etc. We treat conjunctions asymmetrically: The head of the relation is the first conjunct and other conjunctions depend on it via the conj relation. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/conj.html |
| 15 | cop | copula - A copula is the relation between the complement of a copular verb and the copular verb. Copular heads are avoided when possible. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/cop.html |
| 16 | csubj | clausal subject - A clausal subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a clause, i.e., the subject is itself a clause. The governor of this relation might not always be a verb: when the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement of the copular verb. In the two following examples, what she said is the subject. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/csubj.html |
| 17 | csubjpass | clausal passive subject - A clausal passive subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a passive clause. In the example below, that she lied is the subject. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/csubjpass.html |
| 18 | dep | dependent - A dependency is labeled as dep when a system is unable to determine a more precise dependency relation between two words. This may be because of a weird grammatical construction, a limitation in the Stanford Dependency conversion software, a parser error, or because of an unresolved long distance dependency. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/dep.html |
| 19 | det | determiner - A determiner is the relation between the head of an NP and its determiner. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/det.html |
| 20 | det:predet | predeterminer - A predeterminer is the relation between the head of an NP and a word that precedes and modifies the meaning of the NP determiner.| https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/det-predet.html |
| 21 | discourse | discourse element - This is used for interjections and other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the sentence, except in an expressive way). We generally follow the guidelines of what the Penn Treebanks count as an INTJ. They define this to include: interjections (oh, uh-huh, Welcome), fillers (um, ah), and discourse markers (well, like, actually, but not you know). | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/discourse.html |
| 22 | dislocated | dislocated elements - The dislocated relation is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. Dislocated elements are attached to the same governor as the dependent that they double for. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/dislocated.html |
| 23 | dobj | direct object - The direct object of a VP is the noun phrase which is the (accusative) object of the verb. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/dobj.html |
| 24 | expl | expletive - This relation captures an existential there or it in extraposition constructions. There is further discussion and examples on the universal dependency page (expl). | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/expl.html |
| 25 | foreign | foreign words - We use foreign to label sequences of foreign words. These are given a linear analysis: the head is the first token in the foreign phrase. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/foreign.html |
| 26 | goeswith | goes with - This relation links two parts of a word that are separated in text that is not well edited. We follow the treebank: The GW part is the dependent and the head is in some sense the main part, often the second part. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/goeswith.html |
| 27 | iobj | indirect object - The indirect object of a VP is the noun phrase which is the (dative) object of the verb. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/iobj.html |
| 28 | list | list - The list relation is used for chains of comparable items. Web text often contains passages which are meant to be interpreted as lists but are parsed as single sentences. Email signatures in particular contain these structures, in the form of contact information: the different contact information items are labeled as list; the key-value pair relations are labeled as appos. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/list.html |
| 29 | mark | marker - A marker is the word introducing a clause subordinate to another clause. For a complement clause, this will typically be that or whether. For an adverbial clause, the marker is typically a preposition like before or a subordinating conjunction fulfilling a similar role like while or although. The mark is a dependent of the subordinate clause head. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/mark.html |
| 30 | mwe | multi-word expression - The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions with function words that behave like a single function word. Multiword expressions are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure, in which all words in the expression modify the first one using the mwe label. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/mwe.html |
| 31 | name | name - name is one of the three relations for compounding in UD (together with compound and mwe). It is used for proper nouns constituted of multiple nominal elements. For example, name would be used between the words of Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York, or Carl XVI Gustaf but not to replace the usual relations in a phrasal or clausal name like The king of Sweden or the novels The Lord of the Rings and Captured By Aliens. Words joined by name should all be part of a minimal noun phrase; otherwise regular syntactic relations should be used. This is basically similar to the treatment of noun compounds with compound, except that in many cases parts of the name may be another nominal element such as an adjective (United Airlines). | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/name.html |
| 32 | neg | negation modifier - The negation modifier is the relation between a negation word and the word it modifies. It is used both for predicate negation (canonically, not) and nominal negation (canonically no). Dependents labeled neg in the current treebank are the following (in various lowercase/uppercase forms): n, n‚Äôt, neither, never, no, non, not, nt, t. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/neg.html |
| 33 | nmod | nominal modifier - The nmod relation is used for nominal modifiers of nouns or clausal predicates. nmod is a noun functioning as a non-core (oblique) argument or adjunct. In English, nmod is used | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nmod.html |
| 34 | nmod:npmod | noun phrase as adverbial modifier - This relation is a subtype of the nmod relation, which captures the following cases where something syntactically a noun phrase is used as an adverbial modifier in a sentence: | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nmod-npmod.html |
| 35 | nmod:poss | possessive nominal modifier - nmod:poss is used for a nominal modifier which occurs before its head in the specifier position used for ‚Äòs possessives. It is marked with the case ‚Äòs or one of its variant forms. This relation isn‚Äôt used for other pre-head modifiers such as noun compounds or quotative phrases. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nmod-poss.html |
| 36 | nmod:tmod | temporal modifier - A temporal modifier is a subtype of the nmod relation: if the modifier is specifying a time, it is labeled as tmod. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nmod-tmod.html |
| 37 | nsubj | nominal subject - A nominal subject is a noun phrase which is the syntactic subject of a clause. The governor of this relation might not always be a verb: when the verb is a copular verb, the root of the clause is the complement of the copular verb, which can be an adjective or noun. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nsubj.html |
| 38 | nsubjpass | passive nominal subject - A passive nominal subject is a noun phrase which is the syntactic subject of a passive clause. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nsubjpass.html |
| 39 | nummod | numeric modifier - A numeric modifier of a noun is any number phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the noun with a quantity. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/nummod.html |
| 40 | parataxis | parataxis - he parataxis relation (from Greek for ‚Äúplace side by side‚Äù) is a relation between the main verb of a clause and other sentential elements, such as a sentential parenthetical, a clause after a ‚Äú:‚Äù or a ‚Äú;‚Äù, or two sentences placed side by side without any explicit coordination or subordination. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/parataxis.html |
| 41 | punct | punctuation - This is used for any piece of punctuation in a clause, if punctuation is being retained in the typed dependencies. By default, punctuation is not retained in the output.| https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/punct.html |
| 42 | remnant | remnant in ellipsis - The remnant relation is used to provide a satisfactory treatment of ellipsis (in the case of gapping and stripping, where a predicational or verbal head gets elided) without having to postulate empty nodes in the basic representation. This is something that was lacking in earlier versions of SD and provides a basis for being able to reconstruct dependencies in the enhanced representation of SD. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/remnant.html |
| 43 | reparandum | overridden disfluency - We use reparandum to indicate disfluencies overridden in a speech repair. The disfluency is the dependent of the repair.| https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/reparandum.html |
| 44 | root | root - The root grammatical relation points to the root of the sentence. A fake node ‚ÄúROOT‚Äù is used as the governor. The ROOT node is indexed with ‚Äú0‚Äù, since the indexation of real words in the sentence starts at 1. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/root.html |
| 45 | vocative | vocative - The vocative relation is used to mark dialogue participant addressed in text (common in emails and newsgroup postings). The relation links the addressee‚Äôs name to its host sentence. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/vocative.html |
| 46 | xcomp | open clausal complement - An open clausal complement (xcomp) of a verb or an adjective is a predicative or clausal complement without its own subject. The reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the xcomp (normally by the object of the next higher clause, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher clause. These complements are always non-finite, and they are complements (arguments of the higher verb or adjective) rather than adjuncts/modifiers, such as a purpose clause. The name xcomp is borrowed from Lexical-Functional Grammar. | https://universaldependencies.org/docs/en/dep/xcomp.html |
